          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Vitae Interactive is more than a personal portfolio name — it’s the seed of a future
            <strong>independent studio</strong> focused on tight-feeling gameplay, readable systems,
            and projects that <strong>teach as they entertain</strong>.

              <strong>Mission & creative focus</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.4rem;">
                The long-term goal for Vitae Interactive is to grow into a small studio that
                builds <strong>mechanics-driven games</strong> with:
              </p>
              <ul class="project-list" style="margin-top: 0.4rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                <li><strong>Expressive systems</strong> – combat, movement, and abilities that feel great to use.</li>
                <li><strong>Readable design</strong> – clear feedback, strong affordances, and low “design friction”.</li>
                <li><strong>Intentional difficulty curves</strong> – challenge that grows with the player, not against them.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="skills-meta">
                Early prototypes and tools I build now are meant to become the <strong>tech backbone</strong>
                of future Vitae Interactive games.

              <strong>Studio pillars & future offerings</strong>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.4rem;">
                As Vitae Interactive evolves, the studio is imagined around three core pillars:
              </p>
              <ul class="project-list" style="margin-top: 0.4rem;">
                <li><strong>Play</strong> – systems-first games with responsive controls and rich player expression.</li>
                <li><strong>Build</strong> – internal tools and workflows that keep iteration fast and designers unblocked.</li>
                <li><strong>Teach</strong> – sharing breakdowns, tutorials, and assets so other devs can learn from each project.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="skills-meta">
                In the near future, Vitae Interactive will ship <strong>itch.io prototypes</strong>,
                <strong>system-focused asset packs</strong>, and <strong>technical design tutorials</strong>
                alongside more ambitious game projects.
